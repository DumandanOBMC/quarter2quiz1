        <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for banks or governments, using blockchain technology to ensure security and transparency. Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it a scarce and deflationary asset. New bitcoins are generated through mining, a process where participants validate transactions and maintain the network. Stored in digital wallets, Bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or an investment.</p>

        <p>Dogecoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. Initially inspired by the popular "Doge" meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, it quickly gained popularity for its playful community and accessibility. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, with billions of coins in circulation, making it more inflationary by design. Transactions on the Dogecoin network are faster and cheaper, making it a practical choice for microtransactions and tipping content creators online. Dogecoin operates on blockchain technology, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.</p>

        <p>Litecoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google engineer, as a faster and more lightweight alternative to Bitcoin. It uses blockchain technology to enable secure, peer-to-peer transactions while offering quicker block generation times, allowing for faster transaction confirmations. Litecoin has a capped supply of 84 million coins, four times that of Bitcoin, making it a deflationary asset. It employs a more accessible mining algorithm, Scrypt, which makes it less resource-intensive and more inclusive for miners. Often referred to as "the silver to Bitcoin's gold," Litecoin is widely accepted and serves as both a medium of exchange and an investment.</p>
